# What is this repository?

This repository holds the code examples and instructions for Sequoia's microservices workshop. Whereas normally different applications would reside in different git repositories, for the purposes of simplicity, they are grouped here in one repository in subdirectories. Each subdirectory represents a single application or microservice.

This file (`README.md`) will contain information for each step, so you can:
* navigate to the tag for a step
* read the instructions
* look at the latest commit to see what's changed since the last step
* look at the *next* tag to see the "solution" for that step

See [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for more.

# What is this repository?

This repository holds the code examples and instructions for Sequoia's microservices workshop. Whereas normally different applications would reside in different git repositories, for the purposes of simplicity, they are grouped here in one repository in subdirectories. Each subdirectory represents a single application or microservice.

This file (`README.md`) will contain information for each step, so you can:
* navigate to the tag for a step
* read the instructions
* look at the latest commit to see what's changed since the last step
* look at the *next* tag to see the "solution" for that step

# How to use this code to follow the exercises

Each step in the workshop exercises (or most of them at least) will exist here, tagged with the name of the step. Step-1 will have the starting point for exercise 1 with instructions/goals for that exercise. The following step (e.g. Step-2) will have the completed version along with any extra info needed to run that step.

There are two main ways to follow along, which you can switch between as needed:

1. Clone this repository as a starting point, write the code yourself, and use this repository as a reference
2. Clone this repository and check out each step as the beginning of that step

I recommend starting with #1 above and using the diffs on github as a reference or to copy/paste code as desired. If you get stuck, you can check out the next tag & start there.
